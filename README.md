# timer-core
## Goals
Timer core is supposed to be an easy to use go module for providing accurate, simple, stable and tested timers. It is mainly developed to replace the MarathonTools timer code and make it reusable for other projects.
## Subtimers
Subtimers provide an easy way to time multiple things which are related to the main running timer (like players in a speedrun marathon).
